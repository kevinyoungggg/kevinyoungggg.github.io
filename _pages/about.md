# About Me
Currently I’m the third year Master student in the School of Computer Sience and Technology at ]Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. [Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/#/) from 2021. In general, I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.

You can find my CV here: [Kevin's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
