I'm currently a Research Assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Daoyuan Wu](https://daoyuan14.github.io/) and Prof. [Shuai Wang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/). I got my Masterâ€™s degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/#/). Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in June 2021. My research interest includes software engineering and code intelligence.
