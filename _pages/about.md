I’m a third year Master student from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/#/). I received my Bachelor’s degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in June 2021. My research interest includes software engineering and code intelligence.
