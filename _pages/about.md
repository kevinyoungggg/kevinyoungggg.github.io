# About Me
Iâ€™m a third year master student from Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). My research interest includes software engineering, program analysis, and deep learning.


I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/#/) of [ICSOFT Lab](http://www.icsoft.zju.edu.cn/) from School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. 


You can find my CV here: [Kevin's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
