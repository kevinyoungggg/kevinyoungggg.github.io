I’m a third year master student from Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/#/), Zhejiang University. I received my Bachelor’s degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in June 2021. My research interest includes software engineering and code intelligence.
